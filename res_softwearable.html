            <h1>Soft Wearable Robotics</h1>
            <h4>Robotic assistance by using truly portable and lightweight devices</h4><br>
            
            <p>At Harvard, I'm working on wearable robotics, in particular in the field of soft robotics. <b>Soft Exosuits</b> are a promising and quite new paradigm within the wearable robotics domain: the novelty when compared to rigid exoskeletons, is that the frame of the robot is the wearer own skeletal structure. By reducing mechanical links and rigid connections, these devices result lighter and usually more portable. This is actually very useful for applications like rehabilitation robotics, for which one of the most limiting factor is thought to be the amount of time the robotic-therapy can be provided. If we are able to develop truly portable devices, lighter devices that can be worn for longer time, and potentially cheaper devices, by using textile-based pneumatic actuation or cable-driven one, we can imagine impaired people using these devices even in their own homes. The robotic therapy could last multiple hours per day, instead of few hours per week!</p>

            <p>The field is quite young and a lot of work still needs to be done. At Harvard, I'm leading, under the mentoring and help of Prof. Walsh, a project in the field of medical exosuits with the aim of developing assistive upper-limb devices for people with physical disabilities. A real 360&#176; collaboration, involving mechanical engineers, occupational therapists, functional apparel designers and more.</p>

            <p>I'm developing sensing strategies, controls, virtual interfaces firsthand. At the same time, I'm collaborating with graduate students, undergrads, other postdocs and staff members to generally improve the technology that has been developed in this lab, in order to show the efficacy of our solutions and as soon as possible, try to have a positive impact on people's life. Translating the research findings into the real world is an essential drive in this lab and I'm very excited and engaged in this process.</p><br>

            <p>This video is the outcome of a first work we recently published. We tested our prototype on several stroke individuals and assisted our therapist while she was performing usual rehabilitation exercise. We were able to observe reduction in her muscle activity and therefore the therapy was less fatiguing for her: a first initial step towards increasing the number of hours spent doing rehabilitation in clinics!</p>

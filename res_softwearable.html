            <h1>Soft Wearable Robotics</h1>
            <h4>Pushing further robotic assistance by truly portable and lightweight devices</h4><br>
            
            <p>At Harvard, I'm still working on wearable robotics, this time in the field of soft robotics. <b>Soft Exosuits</b> are a promising and quite new paradigm within the wearable robotics domain: the novelty when compared to rigid exoskeletons is that the frame of the robot is the wearers own skeletal structure. By reducing mechanical links and rigid connections, these devices result lighter and usually more portable. This is actually very useful for applications like rehabilitation robotics, where one of the most limiting factor is considered the amount of time the robotic-therapy can be provided. If we are able to develop truly portable devices, lighter devices that can be worn for longer time, and potentially cheaper devices, using textile-based pneumatic actuation or cable-drive one, we can imagine the use of these devices by impaired people even at their own houses. The robotic therapy could last multiple hours per day, instead of few hours per week!</p>

            <p>The field is quite young and lot of works needs to be done. At Harvard, I'm leading, under the mentoring of Prof. Walsh, a group of people working in the field of medical exosuits for assisting the upper-limb of people who have physical disabilities. A real 360&#176; collaboration, involving mechanical engineers, occupational therapists, apparel designers and many more.</p>

            <p>I'm developing sensing strategy, controls, virtual interfaces firsthand. At the same time, I'm collaborating with graduate students, undergrads, other postdocs in other projects to improve the technology that has been developed here at Conor's lab in order to show the efficacy of our solutions and as soon as possible, try to translate this research findings into the real world by creating a real device. This is the final goal of Prof. Walsh lab and I'm very much excited and engaged about making a real impact for people in needs.</p><br>

            <p>The video is the outcome of the first work I did with my group. We tested our prototype on several stroke individuals and assisted our therapist while she was performing usual rehabilitation exercise. We were able to observe reduction in her muscle activity and therefore less fatigue. Potentially, by using this device we could already increase the number of hours spent doing rehabilitation in clinics!</p>
